At that time, however, I was already deep down into a task and felt like I needed to finish it first before shifting my focus.</p>\n<p>Once done with it, I moved onto the assignment and realized that I overlooked some details in the requirements. No big deal, I was still confident I could complete the demo even though the deadline was soon approaching.\nHowever, as time was going by, I started realizing that I needed to make some trade-offs to get things ready and send the demo before the deadline. As it turned out, while I was dead set on showcasing a great demo, I forewent submitting it until the day of the presentation.</p>\n<p>Hustling extra hours and catching little to no sleep to pull a hero move ended up being a complete disaster.\nDuring the presentation, my brain got so cloudy that I couldn’t articulate my design choices (which I was quite satisfied with) nor comprehend the most simple questions from the audience.\nThe whole experience sucked. I realized that, no matter how skilled I could have been, I wouldn’t have been able to pull myself out the whole I had dug myself in.</p>\n<p>Worse, the next day, after finally catching some much-needed sleep, I woke up with all the answers from the presentation. What a raging feeling to realize how wrong the answers you gave the day before were.</p>\n<p><strong>In a world where the hustle mentally is put on the pedestal as the way to success, restlessness will inevitably catch up to you and lead to spectacular adverse effects.</strong></p>\n<p>The things I have learned from my experience might sound cliché to some but will always guarantee the outcome you seek:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set the expectations by validating your understanding of the requirements and confirming any assumptions you are making as early as possible (even before the task is to be started),</li>\n<li>If requirements changes or if you discover something: take pause and reassess your timeline,</li>\n<li>If the timeline needs to change, communicate with other parties as early as possible and provide clear context as to why the changes are required,</li>\n<li>Provide recommendations (cutting features, pushing the deadline) and state the new timeline to reset the expectations.</li>\n<li>Repeat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following this simple feedback loop should help avoid the negative backlash that blowing a deadline will cause, ensuring you to meet expectations every single time.</p>\n<p>Happy face!</p>\n<p>PS: This article was originally published on my <a href=\"https://medium.com/@xlozinguez/no-heroes-18e02ae4f1b8\">Medium</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@xlozinguez\">profile</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"No Heroes","date":"December 01, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2017-12-01-no-heroes/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-11-07-last-day-at-yieldmo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"So, today is my last day @ Yieldmo"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-01-28-getting-started-with-gatsby/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting started with Gatsby"}}}}}
